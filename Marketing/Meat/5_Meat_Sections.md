# ACUMEN LOGIC — 5 Meat Sections

> **What is a "Meat" section?**
> Alex Hormozi defines the "Meat" as the core body of any piece of content — the part between the hook and the CTA where you deliver *actual value*. The Meat is where you prove your credibility, teach something real, tell a story, or present evidence. It's the substance that earns the right to make your CTA. Hormozi's rules: focus on lists, steps, and stories. Lead with proof. Prioritise language and lessons over production. Remove anything that doesn't directly support the message.
>
> **How to use these:** Each Meat section below is a standalone content body designed to pair with any relevant Hook (from the Hooks folder) and any CTA (from the CTA folder). Mix and match to create complete LinkedIn posts, email sequences, ad copy, video scripts, landing page sections, or long-form content.

## Meat Section 1: "The Invisible Gatekeeper"

**Theme:** Why aptitude tests are the #1 bottleneck in UK finance/consulting recruitment — and why most candidates don't even realise it.

**Best paired with:** Pain Hooks (#1–12), Contrarian Hooks (#43–50)

---

Here's what the recruitment pipeline actually looks like at a top UK finance or consulting firm:

**Stage 1: CV Screen** — Filtered by algorithm. If you went to a decent uni with a decent degree, you pass. Thousands do.

**Stage 2: Aptitude Test** — This is where the bloodbath happens. SHL, Kenexa, Watson Glaser, Cubiks — doesn't matter the provider. You get 20–30 minutes. Multiple choice. Numerical reasoning, verbal reasoning, logical reasoning. You're scored against every other candidate in the pool, and the top 15–25% move forward. Everyone else gets a polite rejection email that tells them nothing.

**Stage 3: Video Interview / Assessment Centre** — By this point, you're already in the top quartile. The hard filter is behind you.

**Stage 4: Final Interview** — You're essentially competing against 3–5 other people. Your odds are now excellent.

The problem? Most candidates pour all their energy into Stage 1 (perfecting CVs) and Stage 4 (interview prep). They barely think about Stage 2 — the stage with the highest elimination rate in the entire pipeline.

Here are the numbers that should concern you:

- **86%+ of graduate applicants** to top-tier firms are eliminated before the interview stage
- The single largest elimination event? The aptitude test
- The maths itself is GCSE-level — percentages, ratios, averages, data interpretation
- But the conditions aren't GCSE-level — you're solving problems under extreme time pressure, with deliberately misleading answer options, using data formats you've never seen in a classroom

And here's what nobody says out loud: **the wrong answers are engineered.** They're not random. Each incorrect option corresponds to a specific, predictable mistake — using the wrong row from a table, applying a percentage to the wrong base, misreading a chart axis. If you don't know the traps, you'll fall into them feeling confident you got it right.

This is why "just practise loads of free tests" doesn't work. Practice without understanding *why* you got it wrong is just rehearsing the same errors at higher speed.

Acumen Logic was built to solve exactly this problem. Our 34-lesson course doesn't just give you practice questions — every single wrong answer is mapped to the specific cognitive error that produces it. We teach you to recognise traps before you fall into them, not after.

Because the test that decides your career shouldn't be the one thing you're least prepared for.

## Meat Section 2: "The 6-Skill Reality"

**Theme:** Demystifying what aptitude tests actually measure, and why mastering 6 specific skills is all it takes.

**Best paired with:** Curiosity Hooks (#13–24), Authority Hooks (#25–34)

---

Let's strip away the anxiety and look at what these tests actually require.

Every numerical reasoning test used by UK finance and consulting firms — whether it's SHL, Kenexa, Cubiks, or a proprietary bank assessment — tests the same 6 core skills:

1. **Percentages** — calculating percentage of, percentage change, percentage point difference, reverse percentages
2. **Ratios & Proportions** — dividing quantities, scaling, comparing proportional relationships
3. **Fractions, Decimals & Conversions** — moving between formats, simplifying, comparing
4. **Averages & Growth** — means, weighted averages, compound growth, year-on-year change
5. **Data Interpretation** — reading tables, bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, multi-source data
6. **Speed Arithmetic & Estimation** — mental shortcuts, approximation, eliminating obviously wrong answers quickly

That's it. Six skills. Not advanced mathematics. Not calculus. Not anything you haven't encountered before.

So why do most candidates still fail?

**Three reasons:**

**Reason 1: Time pressure changes everything.**
You have roughly 60–75 seconds per question. That's not enough time to carefully read the data, figure out what's being asked, calculate the answer, and double-check. You need a *method* — a systematic approach for each question type that eliminates wasted seconds. Our course teaches specific frameworks for every question type so your approach is automatic, not improvised.

**Reason 2: The questions are designed to punish common errors.**
Test designers don't create random wrong answers. They create answers that match the exact mistakes most people make. Use the wrong base for a percentage? There's an answer waiting for you. Read the wrong year from a table? There's an answer for that too. If you don't know what the traps are, you'll select them with confidence.

In every Acumen Logic practice question, each wrong answer is traced to a named error: "Option A (£504k) = 18% × £2,800k — this uses annual revenue instead of Q3 total." You learn to see the traps before you see the answers.

**Reason 3: Nobody teaches the format.**
Schools teach maths. Universities teach theory. Career services teach interview skills. Nobody teaches you how to extract data from a table with 6 columns and 14 rows under a 70-second time limit while four deliberately misleading answer options compete for your attention. That's a *specific skill*, and it requires specific training.

Acumen Logic covers all 6 skills across 34 structured lessons — from theory to worked examples to timed practice tests. Every lesson builds on the last. By the end, these tests aren't intimidating. They're routine.

## Meat Section 3: "Wrong vs. Right — How We Teach Differently"

**Theme:** Showcasing Acumen Logic's unique pedagogical approach — trap-mapped wrong answers and the Wrong vs. Right method.

**Best paired with:** Authority Hooks (#25–34), Contrarian Hooks (#43–50)

---

Most test prep works like this: here's a question, here's the answer, here's the method. Move on.

That approach teaches you how to get *one question* right. It doesn't teach you how to *stop getting questions wrong.*

There's a difference — and it's the reason most candidates plateau after weeks of practice.

At Acumen Logic, every single practice question comes with something we call the **Wrong vs. Right breakdown**. Here's how it works:

**Step 1: You see the question.** A data table, a chart, a scenario — just like the real test.

**Step 2: You attempt it.** Four options. Choose one.

**Step 3: The reveal.** This is where we diverge from every other prep course.

Instead of just showing you the correct method, we show you two boxes side by side:

| Common Mistake | Correct Method |
|----------------|----------------|
| The *wrong* method that produces one of the trap answers | The *right* method that produces the correct answer |
| Shows you exactly where the error happens and *why* it feels right | Shows you each step, with the result highlighted |

For example:

> **Question:** Q3 revenue grew by 18% from the previous quarter. If Q2 revenue was £2,400k, what was Q3 revenue?
>
> **Common Mistake:** 18% × £2,800k (annual revenue) = £504k → **Option A**
> *This error uses the wrong base figure — the annual total instead of Q2.*
>
> **Correct Method:** 18% × £2,400k = £432k → Q3 revenue = £2,832k → **Option C**

This does three things that standard prep can't:

1. **It makes the traps visible.** Once you've seen that Option A comes from using the wrong base, you'll never make that error again — on any question, on any test.

2. **It builds pattern recognition, not memorisation.** You start to see the architecture behind wrong answers. After 20–30 of these breakdowns, you can predict where the traps will be before you even calculate.

3. **It inoculates against test anxiety.** Fear on test day comes from uncertainty — *"What if I'm doing this wrong?"* When you've been trained to recognise exactly what "doing it wrong" looks like, the uncertainty disappears.

This is what separates preparation from practice. Practice is volume. Preparation is understanding.

Every one of our 34 lessons uses this method. By the time you sit the real test, you won't just know how to find the right answer — you'll know exactly why each wrong answer exists, and you'll skip past them in seconds.

## Meat Section 4: "The Pressure Protocol"

**Theme:** Addressing test-day psychology and Acumen Logic's unique stress inoculation training.

**Best paired with:** Pain Hooks (#1–12), Aspirational Hooks (#35–42)

---

Here's something no one talks about in aptitude test prep: **the reason most people fail isn't knowledge. It's pressure.**

You can solve percentages. You can read a bar chart. You can calculate an average. You've done it a hundred times in practice.

But practice doesn't have stakes. Practice doesn't have a countdown timer in the corner of your screen. Practice doesn't have the thought in the back of your mind: *"If I fail this, I don't get into Goldman. I don't get into Deloitte. I've wasted the last three months of applications."*

That psychological load changes everything. It makes you:
- Rush through questions and misread data
- Second-guess correct answers and switch to wrong ones
- Freeze on hard questions instead of strategically skipping them
- Lose 10–15 seconds per question on decision paralysis

The top scorers aren't the ones who know more maths. They're the ones who've trained their nervous system to perform under constraint.

This is why Acumen Logic includes an entire module called **Pressure Protocols** (Module 5). It's not motivational fluff. It's structured, evidence-based training across 5 lessons:

**Lesson 5.1 — Time Management Under Pressure:** A framework for allocating seconds across question types. When to invest time, when to skip, and when to estimate. You'll learn the exact triage method top scorers use.

**Lesson 5.2 — Error Pattern Recognition:** How to identify which types of mistakes you personally make under pressure — and build specific countermeasures for each one.

**Lesson 5.3 — Stress Inoculation Training:** Borrowed from performance psychology, this lesson progressively exposes you to higher-pressure simulations so test day feels familiar, not overwhelming.

**Lesson 5.4 — Test Day Protocols:** A tactical checklist for the 24 hours before your test — sleep, environment setup, warm-up routines, and the exact mental framework to use when the timer starts.

**Lesson 5.5 — Full-Length Timed Drill:** A complete, timed assessment under real conditions. No pausing. No peeking. This is where preparation meets reality.

Most prep courses hand you practice tests and call it done. We train you to *perform* under the same conditions you'll face when it counts.

Because on test day, it's not about what you know. It's about what you can access under pressure.

## Meat Section 5: "The Cost of Not Preparing"

**Theme:** The opportunity cost and career impact of failing aptitude tests — making the stakes tangible.

**Best paired with:** Pain Hooks (#1–12), Aspirational Hooks (#35–42), Curiosity Hooks (#13–24)

---

Let's talk about what's actually at stake.

A graduate analyst at a top UK bank starts on £50,000–£70,000. With bonuses, that's £65,000–£95,000 in year one. Within 3 years, you're looking at £100,000–£150,000+. Over a 10-year career in finance, the difference between getting that first role and not getting it is measured in *hundreds of thousands of pounds.*

Now consider the bottleneck: a 25-minute aptitude test that uses GCSE-level maths.

The ROI calculation is almost absurd:

- **Cost of a university degree:** £40,000–£60,000+ (tuition + living costs)
- **Cost of a premium aptitude test course:** A fraction of one month's graduate salary
- **Cost of not preparing and failing the test:** Potentially the entire return on your degree

And it's not just money. It's time. Every failed application cycle means waiting 6–12 months to reapply (most firms only recruit once a year). Fail this autumn and you're not trying again until next autumn. That's a year of your career — gone.

Here's what we see repeatedly:

**Candidate A** has a 2:1 from a top university, strong extracurriculars, a polished CV, and spent 40 hours on interview prep. They do 2–3 free practice tests the night before the aptitude assessment. They fail. They never reach the interview stage. Their CV and interview prep were irrelevant because they never got to use them.

**Candidate B** has a similar profile but spent 15–20 hours working through a structured aptitude course. They understand the question types, they've been trained on the trap answers, they've practised under timed conditions. They score in the top 20% and advance to the interview — where all that CV and interview prep finally matters.

The difference between these two candidates isn't intelligence. It isn't their degree. It's preparation for the one stage that eliminates the most people.

And here's the uncomfortable truth: most candidates don't prepare properly because:

1. **They underestimate the test.** "It's just maths." Yes — but maths under time pressure, with engineered trap answers, scored on a curve against thousands of other candidates.
2. **They assume free resources are enough.** Free tests give you questions but not understanding. They don't explain why you got it wrong or how to avoid the same error next time.
3. **They don't know what they don't know.** Until you've seen a proper Wrong vs. Right breakdown, you don't realise how systematically the tests exploit common errors.

Acumen Logic exists because the highest-stakes moment in your early career shouldn't be the thing you're least prepared for. A structured course that covers all 6 core numerical skills, teaches you to recognise every trap, and trains you to perform under pressure is the single highest-ROI investment a UK finance or consulting applicant can make.

The question isn't whether you can afford to prepare. It's whether you can afford not to.
