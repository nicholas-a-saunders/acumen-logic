## Key Principles Behind These Ads

**1. Every ad drives to ONE action: take the free diagnostic.**
No split CTAs. No "follow me" or "like this post." One action.

**2. The diagnostic sells itself.**
It's free. It's useful. It gives specific results. The ad's job is just to get them there.

**3. Give away the WHAT and WHY. Sell the HOW.**
Ads 02 and 06 teach real things. That's deliberate. The more you give away, the more people trust you. The diagnostic is the bridge between free insight and paid training.

**4. Sound like a person, not a brand.**
These are written in first person. They use "I" not "we." Short sentences. Real talk. No corporate jargon. That's what works on LinkedIn.

**5. Every ad has a different emotional trigger.**
Fear, curiosity, pride, frustration, competitive instinct, financial anxiety, empathy. Different people respond to different triggers. That's why you need 10, not 1.
