I spent 3 years getting a first-class degree.

Tailored my CV for weeks. Got interview coaching. Read every "how to get into banking" guide on the internet.

Then I sat a 25-minute online test and got a generic email two days later:

"Thank you for your interest. After careful consideration, we have decided not to progress your application at this time."

No feedback. No score. No explanation. Just... done.

I didn't even make it to the interview.

And here's what really got me — the maths on that test wasn't hard. Percentages. Ratios. Reading a table. Stuff I'd done at school.

But doing it with a countdown timer in the corner of my screen, four answer options that all looked plausible, and the thought running through my head that this test decides whether I get into Deloitte or spend another year applying?

That's a completely different game.

I later found out that 86% of graduate applicants to top UK firms get eliminated before the interview. And the single biggest filter? The aptitude test. Not the CV. Not the cover letter. A timed multiple-choice test.

The worst part? The wrong answers aren't random. They're designed to match the exact mistakes you're most likely to make. Use the wrong row from a table? There's an answer waiting for you. Calculate percentage of annual revenue instead of quarterly? There's one for that too.

You don't just get it wrong. You get it wrong confidently.

I built something to fix this. A free diagnostic that tests you across Numerical Reasoning, Data Interpretation, and Logical Reasoning — under real timed conditions. 20 questions. 25 minutes. You get a category-by-category breakdown at the end showing exactly where you're strong and where you're not.

No email sequence. No sales call. Just the information you actually need.

If you're applying to banks, Big 4, or consulting firms this year, take 25 minutes and find out where you stand before someone else decides for you.

**Notes:**
- Post the diagnostic link as the first comment, not in the body (LinkedIn algorithm favours this)
- The story angle works because it's relatable — most of the target audience has either experienced this or fears it
- No hard sell. The value is obvious. Let them come to you.
