I'm going to show you something most people don't know about aptitude tests.

The wrong answers aren't random. They're engineered.

Every major test provider — SHL, Aon, Korn Ferry, Cappfinity — designs their incorrect options to match the exact mistakes candidates are most likely to make.

That means if you don't know the traps, you'll select the wrong answer and feel confident you got it right.

Here are the 3 most common traps and how they work:

**TRAP 1: The Wrong Base**

The question asks about Q3 revenue. The table shows Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and a Total column. You need to calculate an 18% increase on Q2 to find Q3.

The trap: you accidentally apply 18% to the Annual Total instead of Q2. That gives you a number. That number is one of the answer options. You pick it. You move on feeling good.

You just got it wrong.

How to spot it: before you calculate anything, underline the specific cell you're working from. Literally point at it. "This number. This row. This column." Takes 3 seconds. Saves the question.

**TRAP 2: The Direction Error**

"Revenue decreased by 12% from Q1 to Q2. What was Q1 revenue if Q2 was £440k?"

Most candidates do: £440k × 1.12 = £492.8k

That's wrong. That calculates a 12% increase FROM £440k. But Q2 is the REDUCED figure. You need: £440k ÷ 0.88 = £500k.

The trap answer (£492.8k) is always there. It matches the most common version of this error — applying the percentage in the wrong direction.

How to spot it: ask yourself, "am I working forwards or backwards?" If the question gives you the AFTER number and asks for the BEFORE number, you divide. Not multiply.

**TRAP 3: The Unit Mismatch**

A table shows revenue in £ thousands. The question asks for the answer in £ millions. Or a chart shows monthly data and the question asks about quarterly totals.

You do the calculation perfectly. Your maths is flawless. But you forgot to convert at the end. And there's an answer option that matches your unconverted number exactly.

How to spot it: before you start, check the units in the question against the units in the data. Circle any mismatch. It's nearly always where the trap is hidden.

These three traps account for the majority of wrong answers on numerical reasoning tests. And the cruel thing is: smart candidates fall for them more than average ones, because they calculate quickly and don't second-guess themselves.

If you want to know how you'd actually perform under real conditions, I built a free diagnostic that tests all three categories — Numerical Reasoning, Data Interpretation, and Logical Reasoning — in 25 minutes.

You get per-category results so you can see exactly where you're solid and where the traps are getting you.

**Notes:**
- This is the "give away the secrets" play. Hormozi's #1 rule: give away the WHAT and the WHY for free, sell the HOW
- Anyone who reads this entire post is a highly qualified lead — they care about aptitude tests
- The specificity (actual worked examples of traps) builds massive credibility
- Saves and shares will be high — this is genuinely useful content people bookmark
- The CTA at the end feels earned, not forced, because you just gave them real value
