A 2:1 from Oxford means nothing on an aptitude test.

Neither does a first from Cambridge. Or LSE. Or Imperial. Or Warwick.

Your degree gets you past the CV screen. That's its job. And it does it well.

But here's what happens next:

You get an email saying "Please complete the following online assessment within 5 days." You click the link. You see a timer. You see a table full of numbers. You see four answer options.

And your degree cannot help you.

The test doesn't care where you studied. It doesn't care about your dissertation. It doesn't care that you got 78% in Financial Accounting.

It cares about one thing: can you extract the right number from the right row of the right table, calculate the correct answer, and select it from four deliberately misleading options — in under 70 seconds?

That's a specific skill. And universities don't teach it.

I know this because I talk to graduates from top universities every week who are genuinely shocked they failed. They say things like:

"But the maths was easy."
"I don't understand, I'm good at numbers."
"I definitely got most of them right."

The maths IS easy. That's not the problem.

The problem is doing easy maths under time pressure while four answer options are specifically designed to match the exact mistakes your brain wants to make.

Use the wrong column? There's an answer for that.
Calculate the right thing from the wrong year? There's one for that too.
Forget to convert quarterly to annual? Yep. Another trap answer waiting.

Your degree taught you how to think. It didn't teach you how to perform under the specific conditions of a 25-minute aptitude test.

That's a gap. And it's fixable.

I built a free diagnostic that tests you under real conditions — 20 questions, 25 minutes, across Numerical Reasoning, Data Interpretation, and Logical Reasoning. You get a breakdown showing exactly where you're sharp and where you're exposed.

If you're from a top university and you've never sat a proper timed aptitude assessment, this might surprise you. Take it and find out.

**Notes:**
- This ad targets the "overconfident" segment — top-uni students who assume they'll breeze through
- The specific university names (Oxford, Cambridge, LSE, Imperial, Warwick) are chosen because they're the exact schools most represented in Big 4/IB applications
- The quotes from graduates feel authentic and relatable
- Challenging their confidence is what makes them click — they want to prove the post wrong
