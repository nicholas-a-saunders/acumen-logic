Take this test. I dare you.

25 minutes. 20 questions. Numerical Reasoning, Data Interpretation, Logical Reasoning.

Timed. No pausing. No googling. Just you and a countdown clock.

It's the same format used by SHL, Korn Ferry, and Aon — the providers behind Goldman Sachs, KPMG, Deloitte, JP Morgan, and Barclays assessments.

Most candidates think they'll score well. Most candidates are wrong.

Not because the maths is hard. The maths is GCSE-level. Percentages. Ratios. Reading a table.

But when the timer's running and the answer options are designed to match your most likely mistakes? That's a different game entirely.

The confident ones are usually the ones who get caught. They calculate fast, pick an answer, and move on. They don't realise the answer they picked was a trap — built from the exact wrong method they just used.

So here's the deal.

I built this diagnostic. It's free. Completely free. No credit card. No sales pitch afterwards.

You take it. You get your results broken down by category. You find out if you're as ready as you think you are.

If you score well — brilliant. You've got evidence you're prepared. Print the results and feel good about yourself.

If you don't — better to find out now than when it actually counts.

Either way, you learn something. And it costs you nothing but 25 minutes.

So... are you going to take it or scroll past?

**Notes:**
- Finance candidates are competitive by nature. "I dare you" triggers the exact impulse that makes them click.
- The "most candidates think they'll score well" line creates doubt — which is more powerful than certainty for driving action
- "Scroll past" at the end is a micro-challenge. Nobody wants to be the person who backed down.
- This ad works especially well with younger candidates (final year students, recent grads)
- Consider pairing this with a simple image: a timer showing 25:00 or a score card with question marks
