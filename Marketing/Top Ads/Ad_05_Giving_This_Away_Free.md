I built a finance aptitude assessment and I'm giving it away for free.

Not a "free trial." Not a "free sample." The whole thing.

20 real questions. Numerical Reasoning. Data Interpretation. Logical Reasoning. Timed at 25 minutes — same conditions you'll face when you sit the real test for Goldman, KPMG, Deloitte, JP Morgan, Barclays, PwC, EY, or any firm that uses SHL, Aon, or Korn Ferry assessments.

When you finish, you get a full category breakdown. Not just "you scored 72%." You see your score in each of the three categories, so you know exactly which area is pulling you down.

Here's what it doesn't require:
- No credit card
- No phone number
- No 30-minute webinar first
- No "book a call" button
- No upsell pop-up halfway through

Just the assessment and your results.

Why am I giving this away?

Because the aptitude test is the single biggest elimination point in UK finance recruitment. 86% of applicants don't make it past this stage. And most of them have no idea which specific category is costing them.

They apply. They get the test. They do their best. They get rejected. They assume they need to "practise more." They practise more of the same stuff. They apply again. Same result.

The diagnostic breaks that cycle. When you know your specific bottleneck — is it percentages? Data tables? Logical reasoning? — you can actually fix it. That's the whole point.

If you're applying to any finance, consulting, or Big 4 role in the UK this year, take 25 minutes and do this.

Worst case? You confirm you're ready.
Best case? You find the blind spot that would've cost you the offer.

**Notes:**
- This is the Hormozi "irresistible offer" structure: state the value clearly, remove every objection, explain the reasoning, make the ask
- The "what it doesn't require" list directly addresses lead magnet fatigue — people are sick of giving their details for garbage
- "No catch. Seriously." works because people genuinely don't expect it
- This is the ad to boost/promote if you're spending any money — highest conversion potential
