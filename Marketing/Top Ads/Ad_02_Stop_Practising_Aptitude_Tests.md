Stop practising aptitude tests.

I mean it. Close the free SHL practice test. Stop grinding random questions on JobTestPrep. Put down the app.

Here's why:

Practising without understanding why you got it wrong is just rehearsing the same mistakes faster.

I see it constantly. Someone does 200 practice questions over two weeks. They get the same types wrong every time. They sit the real test. They fail. They're confused because they "practised loads."

Practice is not preparation. They're different things.

Practice is volume — doing more questions.
Preparation is understanding — knowing WHY each wrong answer exists and what mistake produces it.

Here's something most people don't know: on every aptitude test used by SHL, Korn Ferry, Aon, and Cappfinity, the wrong answers aren't random. Each one corresponds to a specific, predictable error.

Use the wrong base figure for a percentage? Option B is waiting for you.
Read the wrong year from a table? That's Option D.
Apply growth to the wrong starting number? Hello, Option A.

The test designers KNOW the mistakes you'll make. They build the answers around them.

So when you "practise" without learning to see these traps, you're just getting faster at falling into them.

Here's what actually works:

1. Understand the 6 core skills every test covers (percentages, ratios, fractions, averages, data interpretation, speed arithmetic)
2. Learn what the trap answers look like for each skill
3. Train under timed conditions so pressure doesn't undo your preparation

That's it. That's the whole method.

I built a free 25-minute diagnostic that tests you on all three categories — Numerical Reasoning, Data Interpretation, Logical Reasoning — and tells you exactly which one is your bottleneck.

No guessing. No "you scored 64%." Actual category-by-category results so you know where to focus.

It's free. It takes 25 minutes. And it'll tell you more about your readiness than 200 random practice questions ever will.

**Notes:**
- The contrarian open ("Stop practising") is designed to stop the scroll. Nobody expects to be told to stop doing the thing they think is helping.
- The reframe from "practice" to "preparation" is Acumen Logic's core positioning
- Lists and short sentences keep it scannable
- Ends with a clear, no-pressure CTA to the diagnostic
