# Ad 09 — It's 11pm the Night Before Your Assessment

**Platform:** LinkedIn (micro-story, immersive)
**Format:** Present-tense story → pattern recognition → reframe → CTA
**Tone:** Intimate, second-person, almost cinematic. Puts the reader inside the moment.
**Goal:** Trigger the anxiety they already feel about being underprepared. Position the diagnostic as the smart move they can make RIGHT NOW.

It's 11pm the night before your assessment.

You're sitting in bed with your laptop open. You've just googled "SHL numerical reasoning practice" for the third time this week. You're clicking through free questions on some random website. Getting most of them right. Some of them wrong. Not really sure why.

You tell yourself it'll be fine. The maths isn't that hard. You're good with numbers. You did well in your degree. How bad can a 25-minute test be?

You close the laptop at midnight. Set your alarm. Try to sleep.

The next morning, you open the test link. The timer starts. 25 minutes.

The first question is fine. The second one takes longer than you expected. By the fourth question, you're spending 90 seconds on each and the timer says 18 minutes left for 16 questions.

A table with 6 columns and 12 rows appears. The question asks about Q3 operating margin as a percentage of total revenue. You're not sure which row is Q3. Two columns look relevant. You pick the one that seems right and calculate. Your answer matches Option B. You click it and move on.

It was Option C. You used the wrong column.

But you don't know that. You won't find out. You'll never see your score or which questions you got wrong.

Two days later, you get the email.

Everyone knows someone who's lived this. Maybe you have.

The thing is, none of this had to happen. The questions aren't hard. The traps are predictable. The time pressure is manageable — if you've experienced it before.

The candidates who pass aren't smarter. They've just done this before under timed conditions and they know what to expect.

That's all the diagnostic is. A dress rehearsal.

20 questions. 25 minutes. Real timed conditions. Category breakdown at the end so you know exactly where you stand.

You can do it tonight. It's free. And it beats the hell out of googling "SHL practice test" at 11pm the night before it actually matters.

**Notes:**
- This is the "movie scene" ad. It puts the reader inside a moment they either remember or dread.
- Second-person ("you're sitting in bed") creates immediate immersion
- The slow build of anxiety mirrors the actual test experience
- The pivot from story to CTA is clean: "None of this had to happen"
- The final line ("beats the hell out of googling at 11pm") is memorable and shareable
- This ad will resonate hardest during Sept–Nov and Jan–Mar (peak application seasons)
