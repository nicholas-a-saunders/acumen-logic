Unpopular opinion: university career services are setting graduates up to fail at the one stage that matters most.

I've got nothing against career advisors. They mean well. They help with CVs. They run mock interviews. They bring employers on campus for networking events. That's all good stuff.

But here's what they don't do:

They don't teach you how to pass the aptitude test.

And the aptitude test is the single biggest elimination point in graduate recruitment for finance, consulting, and Big 4 firms. 86% of applicants are gone before the interview. Not because of their CV. Not because of their interview skills. Because of a 25-minute timed test.

Think about that.

Your uni helps you perfect your CV (which gets you past the first screen). They help you prepare for interviews (which come third or fourth in the process). But the massive bottleneck in between — the stage that kills the most applications — gets a handout saying "try these free practice resources."

Free practice resources that give you questions but no explanations. That score you but don't break it down by category. That let you practise without ever understanding what you're getting wrong or why.

It's like a driving instructor teaching you how to park and how to pass the theory test, but skipping the actual driving exam.

The gap is real. And it's costing graduates offers they've spent three years and £40k+ working towards.

I'm not saying this to have a go at universities. I'm saying it because someone needs to fill this gap, and I decided to build the thing that does.

I made a free diagnostic assessment. 20 questions. 25 minutes. Numerical Reasoning, Data Interpretation, Logical Reasoning. Timed, scored, and broken down by category.

It's what your career service should have given you. It's free. And it'll show you exactly where you need to focus before you sit the real thing.

If your uni didn't prepare you for this, prepare yourself. 25 minutes. Link below.

**Notes:**
- "Unpopular opinion" posts consistently drive engagement on LinkedIn — people either agree loudly or disagree loudly. Both are good.
- This ad identifies a real gap that students feel but haven't articulated. That's powerful.
- Tone is crucial here: it's NOT attacking universities. It's identifying a structural gap. The line "I've got nothing against career advisors" is important — keeps it respectful.
- "It's what your career service should have given you" is the positioning line. That's what makes people click.
- This ad can be repurposed for university-specific targeting: "If you're at [Uni] and applying to finance roles..."
