# Ad 03 — The £200,000 Question

**Platform:** LinkedIn (short-form, punchy)
**Format:** Numbers-led → ROI reframe → CTA
**Tone:** Blunt, factual, no fluff
**Goal:** Make the financial stakes so obvious that NOT taking the diagnostic feels irrational

Quick maths for anyone applying to finance or consulting roles this year:

Graduate analyst at a Big 4 firm: £50k–£70k starting.
Graduate at an investment bank: £60k–£90k+ with bonus.
3-year earnings in that role: £200k–£350k.
10-year career trajectory difference: £500k+.

The bottleneck between you and all of that?

A 25-minute online test using GCSE-level maths.

Not your degree. Not your interview skills. Not your networking. A timed multiple-choice test that 86% of applicants fail.

You spent £40,000+ on university. You'll spend weeks on your CV. Hours on cover letters. Days preparing for interviews.

How long will you spend preparing for the one stage that eliminates more candidates than every other stage combined?

Most people? About 45 minutes on a free practice test the night before.

That's not a strategy. That's a coin flip with your career.

I built a free diagnostic. 20 questions. 25 minutes. Tests you across Numerical Reasoning, Data Interpretation, and Logical Reasoning under real timed conditions.

At the end, you see exactly which category is your weakness — before an employer does.

It costs nothing. It takes less time than an episode of your favourite show. And it might be the most useful 25 minutes you spend this year.

Take it. Link's below.

**Notes:**
- This is the "spreadsheet brain" ad — it appeals to the analytical, ROI-focused mindset of finance applicants
- Short paragraphs and line breaks make it easy to scan
- The £200k+ framing makes the diagnostic feel like an absurdly good deal (it's free)
- "Quick maths" opening sounds natural and conversational
