# Ad 07 — The Email Nobody Reads Twice

**Platform:** LinkedIn (short emotional post)
**Format:** Emotional hook → shared experience → reframe → CTA
**Tone:** Raw, empathetic, real. No corporate polish.
**Goal:** Connect emotionally with candidates who've been rejected and don't know why. Drive them to the diagnostic for answers.

You know the email.

"Thank you for your interest in [Firm]. After careful consideration, we have decided not to progress your application at this time. We wish you the best in your future endeavours."

Two sentences. That's it. No score. No feedback. No explanation. No "here's what you got wrong." Just... done.

You stare at it for about 10 seconds. Then you close your laptop and try not to think about it for the rest of the day.

But you do think about it. Obviously you think about it.

What went wrong? Was it the test? Was it my CV? Did I misread a question? Was I too slow? Were other people just better?

You'll never know. They don't tell you.

And that's the part that really stings — not the rejection itself, but the fact that you have absolutely no idea what to fix.

So you do what everyone does. You google "aptitude test practice." You grind some free questions for a few hours. You apply to the next firm. You sit the next test.

Same result. Same email. Same two sentences.

Here's what I wish someone had told me: the problem isn't that you failed. The problem is that you don't know WHERE you failed. Was it numerical reasoning? Data interpretation? Logical reasoning? Was it speed? Accuracy? A specific question type?

Without that information, you're just guessing what to improve. And guessing is what got you the rejection in the first place.

I built a diagnostic that gives you the answer the rejection email never will.

20 questions. 25 minutes. Real timed conditions. At the end, you see your score broken down by category — Numerical Reasoning, Data Interpretation, Logical Reasoning — so you can see exactly where the gap is.

It's free. It takes less time than scrolling LinkedIn for the next hour. And unlike that rejection email, it actually tells you something useful.

**Notes:**
- This is the emotional resonance ad. It doesn't teach. It doesn't argue. It empathises.
- Almost everyone in the target audience has received this exact email. It's an instant connection.
- The power is in the specificity of the emotional experience — "stare at it for 10 seconds, close your laptop"
- The diagnostic is positioned as the answer to the frustration, not as a product to buy
- This ad will get comments. People will share their own rejection stories. Engagement drives reach.
