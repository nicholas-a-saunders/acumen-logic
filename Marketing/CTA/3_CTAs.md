# ACUMEN LOGIC — 3 Calls to Action (CTAs)

> **What is a CTA?**
> The Call to Action is the final element of any piece of content, following the Hook and Meat. It tells the reader exactly what to do next. Alex Hormozi's CTA framework is built on his Value Equation: increase the dream outcome and perceived likelihood of achievement, while decreasing time delay and effort/sacrifice. Great CTAs include specificity, urgency, risk reversal, and a clear next step.
>
> **How to use these:** Each CTA below is designed to close out content pieces that begin with a Hook and are supported by a Meat section. They are written at different intensity levels to suit different platforms and content types. Adapt the specific URLs, pricing, and offer details to match your current campaign.

## CTA 1: The Direct Enrollment CTA

**Intensity:** High — direct ask, best for warm audiences
**Best for:** Landing pages, email sequences, retargeting ads, bottom-of-funnel LinkedIn posts, sales pages
**Best paired with:** Meat Sections 1, 2, 4, 5

---

Here's what you get with Acumen Logic:

- **34 structured lessons** covering every question type you'll face — numerical reasoning, data interpretation, logical reasoning, verbal reasoning
- **6 core skill modules** built from the ground up — percentages, ratios, fractions, averages, data interpretation, speed arithmetic
- **Wrong vs. Right breakdowns on every practice question** — each wrong answer is mapped to the exact mistake that produces it, so you stop making errors instead of repeating them
- **Pressure Protocol training** — an entire module dedicated to time management, error pattern recognition, stress inoculation, and test-day performance
- **Full-length timed mock assessments** — simulate the real thing under real conditions so test day feels familiar
- **Pure self-paced learning** — no scheduled calls, no cohorts to keep up with. Work through it on your timetable, at your pace

You've spent years and tens of thousands of pounds getting to this point. The aptitude test is the last barrier between you and the career you've been working toward.

**Don't leave it to chance.**

## CTA 2: The Soft-Entry CTA

**Intensity:** Medium — lower commitment, best for cold/warm audiences
**Best for:** Top-of-funnel LinkedIn posts, awareness-stage ads, organic social content, podcast mentions, blog posts
**Best paired with:** Meat Sections 1, 3, 4

If you're applying to finance or consulting roles in the UK this year, the aptitude test will be the single biggest filter between you and an offer.

Most candidates don't prepare for it properly — and most don't get a second chance.

We built Acumen Logic to change that. 34 lessons. Every question type. Every trap answer explained. Pressure training included.

**Want to see how it works?**

→ **[Check out the full course breakdown and see if it's right for you.]**

No pressure. No sales call. Just the information you need to decide whether this is worth your time.

## CTA 3: The Social Proof / Urgency CTA

**Intensity:** High — leverages proof and scarcity, best for conversion-focused campaigns
**Best for:** Retargeting ads, email sequences (especially final emails in a sequence), limited-time promotions, seasonal recruitment cycle pushes (Sept–Nov, Jan–Mar)
**Best paired with:** Meat Sections 2, 3, 5

---

Recruitment season doesn't wait.

The top UK banks and consulting firms run their graduate intake once a year. The aptitude test comes early in the process — often within days of submitting your application. By the time you get the test invite, it's too late to start preparing from scratch.

Candidates who go through structured preparation consistently outscore those who rely on free practice tests alone. That's not opinion — it's how deliberate, trap-aware training works versus unstructured repetition.

Acumen Logic gives you:
- 34 lessons covering every numerical, data, logical, and verbal reasoning skill
- Trap-mapped practice questions where every wrong answer teaches you something
- A full Pressure Protocols module so you perform under timed conditions
- Mock assessments that replicate the real test environment

The course is self-paced, so you can complete it in as little as 2–3 weeks of focused work — or spread it across a month alongside your applications.

**Applications are open now. Your aptitude test could be weeks away.**

→ **[Start Acumen Logic today and walk into test day fully prepared.]**

## CTA Selection Guide

| Scenario | Recommended CTA | Why |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| Landing page / sales page | CTA 1 (Direct Enrollment) | High-intent visitors need clear value stack and direct action |
| LinkedIn post / organic social | CTA 2 (Soft-Entry) | Lower commitment matches the platform; builds trust before asking for the sale |
| Retargeting ad / email sequence | CTA 3 (Social Proof / Urgency) | Audience already knows you; urgency and proof push them over the line |
| Top-of-funnel awareness ad | CTA 2 (Soft-Entry) | Cold audiences need information, not a hard sell |
| Seasonal recruitment push (Sept–Nov) | CTA 3 (Social Proof / Urgency) | Time pressure is real and the audience feels it |
| Blog / long-form content | CTA 1 (Direct Enrollment) | Reader has invested time in content; they're ready for the full pitch |
| Podcast / video script | CTA 2 (Soft-Entry) | Verbal delivery suits a conversational, low-pressure ask |

## Assembling a Complete Content Piece

Every piece of Acumen Logic marketing content follows this structure:

```
HOOK (from /Marketing/Hooks/)
    ↓
MEAT (from /Marketing/Meat/)
    ↓
CTA (from /Marketing/CTA/)
```

**Example Assembly:**

> **Hook 6:** "The difference between a £65k graduate offer and a rejection email? 18 questions in 20 minutes."
>
> **Meat 5:** "The Cost of Not Preparing" — walks through the financial stakes and opportunity cost
>
> **CTA 1:** Direct Enrollment — full value stack and enrolment link

This produces a complete LinkedIn post, email, or ad that takes the reader from attention → understanding → action.

Mix and match freely. The hooks, meat sections, and CTAs are designed to be modular.
