# ACUMEN LOGIC — 50 Marketing Hooks

> **Usage:** Each hook is a standalone opening line designed for LinkedIn posts, short-form video, ad copy, email subject lines, or social media captions. Pair each hook with a Meat section and CTA to create a complete piece of content.
>
> **Framework:** Modelled on Alex Hormozi's hook principles — short, direct, specific, pattern-interrupting. No filler. Every hook earns the next line.

## Category 1: Pain / Problem Hooks (Hooks 1–12)

These hooks call out the specific pain your audience is already feeling. They work because they make the reader feel *seen*.

---

**Hook 1**
You didn't lose the Goldman offer because of your CV. You lost it at the aptitude test.

**Hook 2**
86% of graduate applicants to UK finance firms are eliminated before the interview. Here's what eliminates them.

**Hook 3**
The maths on an aptitude test is GCSE-level. So why do most graduates still fail it?

**Hook 4**
I had a 2:1 from a Russell Group uni. I got rejected by every bank I applied to — because of a 25-minute online test.

**Hook 5**
You're not bad at maths. You're bad at maths under a timer with your career on the line.

**Hook 6**
The difference between a £65k graduate offer and a rejection email? 18 questions in 20 minutes.

**Hook 7**
Nobody tells you this — but the aptitude test is the hardest part of getting into finance. Not the interview. Not the CV. The test.

**Hook 8**
You'll spend 3 years getting a degree. Then lose the job to a 25-minute numerical reasoning test you didn't prepare for.

**Hook 9**
"I'm just not a maths person" is the most expensive sentence in UK graduate recruitment.

**Hook 10**
The rejection email doesn't say "you failed the aptitude test." It says "we've decided not to progress your application." You never even find out why.

**Hook 11**
You practised with free online tests and still failed. Here's what free tests don't teach you.

**Hook 12**
There are candidates with worse degrees than you working at the firm that rejected you. The only difference? They prepared for the test differently.

---

## Category 2: Curiosity / Pattern-Interrupt Hooks (Hooks 13–24)

These break the scroll by saying something unexpected. They create an open loop the reader *has* to close.

---

**Hook 13**
The fastest way to get into finance has nothing to do with networking.

**Hook 14**
I've seen candidates go from failing every aptitude test to scoring in the top 15%. Here's the method.

**Hook 15**
There's a 4-second trick that instantly tells you which answer is the trap on a numerical reasoning test.

**Hook 16**
Banks don't care how smart you are. They care how fast you are.

**Hook 17**
If you're applying to finance or consulting roles in the UK, stop updating your CV. Do this instead.

**Hook 18**
Most aptitude test prep is backwards. Here's why.

**Hook 19**
The test isn't measuring what you think it's measuring.

**Hook 20**
What if I told you the wrong answers on aptitude tests are designed to match the exact mistakes most people make?

**Hook 21**
There are only 6 core skills on every numerical reasoning test. Master them and you'll outperform 85% of candidates.

**Hook 22**
A 2:1 from Oxford gets you past the CV screen. It does nothing for the aptitude test. Here's what does.

**Hook 23**
The biggest lie in graduate recruitment: "You can't prepare for aptitude tests."

**Hook 24**
Your competition isn't 10,000 applicants. It's the 2,000 who actually prepared for the test.

---

## Category 3: Authority / Proof Hooks (Hooks 25–34)

These establish credibility immediately. They answer "Why should I listen to you?" before the reader even asks.

---

**Hook 25**
We built a 34-lesson course that teaches you to think like the test is designed — not just memorise formulas.

**Hook 26**
Every wrong answer on our practice tests traces back to a named mistake. That's how you stop making them.

**Hook 27**
We reverse-engineered the scoring system used by SHL, Kenexa, and Watson Glaser. Here's what we found.

**Hook 28**
Our course was built by people who actually work in finance — not by a test prep factory.

**Hook 29**
After coaching hundreds of candidates through UK aptitude tests, here are the 3 patterns that predict failure.

**Hook 30**
We don't teach "tips and tricks." We teach the underlying reasoning that makes tips unnecessary.

**Hook 31**
The average aptitude test gives you 60–75 seconds per question. We train you to solve them in 45.

**Hook 32**
Acumen Logic doesn't sell motivation. We sell the 6 numerical skills that appear on every test and the pressure protocols to use them under a timer.

**Hook 33**
We've mapped every trap answer to the specific cognitive error that produces it. That's the difference between practice and preparation.

**Hook 34**
Our students don't just "pass." They score in the top percentiles — because the course is designed by the scoring logic, not against it.

---

## Category 4: Aspirational / Identity Hooks (Hooks 35–42)

These speak to who the reader wants to become. They sell the transformation, not the product.

---

**Hook 35**
The elite candidates aren't smarter. They're just prepared for the thing nobody else prepares for.

**Hook 36**
In 34 lessons, you'll go from "I hope I pass" to "I know I'll score in the top 20%."

**Hook 37**
The people who get into Goldman, McKinsey, and Deloitte aren't guessing on aptitude tests. They've trained.

**Hook 38**
There are two types of candidates: those who practise aptitude tests, and those who prepare for them. Only one type gets the offer.

**Hook 39**
You worked too hard for your degree to let a 25-minute test decide your career.

**Hook 40**
Imagine walking into test day knowing you've already solved harder questions than anything they can throw at you.

**Hook 41**
Your dream employer doesn't know you yet. The aptitude test is your first impression. Make it count.

**Hook 42**
You're one test away from the career you've been working toward for 3 years. Treat it like one.

---

## Category 5: Contrarian / Myth-Busting Hooks (Hooks 43–50)

These challenge conventional wisdom and position Acumen Logic as the authority that sees what others don't.

---

**Hook 43**
"Just practise loads of tests" is the worst aptitude test advice on the internet. Here's why.

**Hook 44**
Speed isn't about being fast. It's about not being slow. There's a difference, and most people miss it.

**Hook 45**
The free aptitude test resources online are training you to fail. I'm serious.

**Hook 46**
You don't need to be "good at maths" to ace a numerical reasoning test. You need to be good at reading tables under pressure.

**Hook 47**
Aptitude tests aren't IQ tests. They're performance tests. And performance can be trained.

**Hook 48**
Everyone focuses on getting the right answer. The top scorers focus on eliminating the wrong ones.

**Hook 49**
Your university didn't prepare you for this. Neither did your internship. Neither did your career advisor. Here's what actually will.

**Hook 50**
Practising without understanding *why* you got it wrong is just rehearsing failure. There's a better way.
