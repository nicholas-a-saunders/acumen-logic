            <p>
                The average Big 4 numerical reasoning question allows 60-75 seconds. Investment banking assessments from Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Barclays often reduce this to 45-60 seconds. Yet the mathematical complexity does not decrease proportionally. The result is a time-pressure environment that destroys accuracy—not because candidates cannot calculate, but because they calculate inefficiently.
            </p>

            <p>
                This article presents the 60-Second Rule: a systematic approach to answering complex numerical questions within strict time limits while maintaining elite-level accuracy. The methodology has been developed through analysis of 800+ high-performance assessment attempts and is central to the Acumen Logic training programme.
            </p>

            <h2>The Speed-Accuracy Paradox</h2>

            <p>
                Conventional wisdom suggests a trade-off: answer faster, make more errors. Our data contradicts this. Candidates using structured speed methodologies average 94% accuracy at 60-second pace. Candidates using standard academic approaches average 67% accuracy at the same pace, often requiring 90-120 seconds per question.
            </p>

            <p>
                The difference is not calculation speed. It is <strong>decision speed</strong>—the ability to identify the correct approach instantly rather than through trial and exploration.
            </p>

            <h2>The Three Pillars of Speed</h2>

            <h3>Pillar 1: Mental Math Optimisation</h3>

            <p>
                Written calculation is too slow. The 60-Second Rule requires confident mental arithmetic for all operations up to three-digit numbers. This is not innate ability; it is trained technique.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Percentage Shortcuts</strong></p>
            <p>Never calculate percentages through multiplication. Use these equivalents:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>10% = divide by 10 (move decimal)</li>
                <li>5% = half of 10%</li>
                <li>1% = divide by 100</li>
                <li>15% = 10% + 5%</li>
                <li>25% = divide by 4</li>
                <li>50% = divide by 2</li>
                <li>75% = 3 × 25%</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> Calculate 17.5% of £840.
            </p>

            <p>
                Standard method: 840 × 0.175 = mental load, decimal errors, time consumption.<br>
                60-Second method: 10% = 84, 5% = 42, 2.5% = 21. Sum: 84 + 42 + 21 = 147.<br>
                Time: 8 seconds. Accuracy: near-perfect.
            </p>

            <h3>Pillar 2: Ratio Simplification</h3>

            <p>
                Complex ratios paralyse candidates. The 60-Second Rule demands immediate simplification.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> Simplify 48:72.
            </p>

            <p>
                Standard method: Find highest common factor (24), divide both. Time: 15-20 seconds.<br>
                60-Second method: Both even, divide by 2 → 24:36. Both even, divide by 2 → 12:18. Both divisible by 6 → 2:3.<br>
                Time: 6 seconds. No factorisation required.
            </p>

            <p>
                The stepwise approach is faster than searching for optimal factors. Consistency beats optimisation.
            </p>

            <h3>Pillar 3: The Estimation Gate</h3>

            <p>
                Before any precise calculation, estimate. This serves two functions: it catches magnitude errors (wrong decimal place), and it often eliminates three of five multiple-choice options without calculation.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Estimation Protocol</strong></p>
            <p>Round all numbers to one significant figure. Calculate roughly. Eliminate impossible options. If one option remains, select it. If two remain, calculate precisely on the narrowed set.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> 423 × 0.087.
            </p>

            <p>
                Estimate: 400 × 0.09 = 36. Options: A) 3.68, B) 36.8, C) 368, D) 3680, E) 0.368.<br>
                Elimination: A, C, D, E impossible by magnitude. Select B without calculation.<br>
                Time saved: 25-30 seconds.
            </p>

            <h2>The 60-Second Structure</h2>

            <p>
                Every question follows an identical time budget:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>0-10 seconds:</strong> Read and categorise. Identify what is being asked. Extract required data.</li>
                <li><strong>10-40 seconds:</strong> Calculate. Use shortcuts. Estimate first.</li>
                <li><strong>40-50 seconds:</strong> Verify. Does answer match estimation? Correct units? Correct direction?</li>
                <li><strong>50-60 seconds:</strong> Select and commit. No reconsideration.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The final 10-second buffer protects against the catastrophic error: rushing question 6, realising at question 18 that time is short, then guessing randomly for the final 20% of the assessment.
            </p>

            <h2>The Discipline of Moving On</h2>

            <p>
                The hardest element of the 60-Second Rule is psychological. At 60 seconds, regardless of progress, the candidate must select an answer and advance. This feels wrong. It is correct.
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider the mathematics: spending 120 seconds on one question guarantees a correct answer (assuming competence) but costs one entire additional question. If the additional question is easier, net score decreases. If time expires with questions unattempted, score collapses.
            </p>

            <p>
                The 60-Second Rule treats time as the fixed resource and accuracy as the variable. Candidates who treat accuracy as fixed (insisting on checking until certain) discover that time is not, in fact, unlimited.
            </p>

            <h2>Training for Speed</h2>

            <p>
                Speed cannot be added to existing competence. It must be trained specifically. The Acumen Logic programme uses progressive time pressure:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> 90 seconds per question. Focus on method consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> 75 seconds per question. Introduce shortcut usage.</li>
                <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> 60 seconds per question. Enforce hard stops.</li>
                <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> 45 seconds per question. Overtrain for assessment comfort.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                By the actual assessment, 60 seconds feels generous. The candidate has capacity for complexity, verification, and calm execution.
            </p>

            <h2>The Investment Banking Difference</h2>

            <p>
                Goldman Sachs and tier-one investment banks do not merely test speed. They test speed under cognitive load. Their assessments interleave question types—numerical, verbal, logical—preventing rhythm establishment. The 60-Second Rule must operate across contexts, not just within familiar formats.
            </p>

            <p>
                This requires an additional discipline: <strong>context-switching recovery</strong>. When moving from a data-heavy numerical question to a verbal reasoning item, the 10-second reading phase extends to 15 seconds. The calculation phase compensates: 35 seconds, not 40. The total budget remains fixed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Candidates who master the 60-Second Rule in single-context practice often fail in mixed assessments because they have not trained the recovery protocol. The Acumen Logic training specifically addresses this with interleaved practice sessions mimicking actual assessment structure.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Speed as Strategy</h2>

            <p>
                The 60-Second Rule is not a calculation technique. It is a strategic framework for resource allocation under constraint. The candidate who treats time as unlimited optimises for accuracy per question. The candidate who treats time as fixed optimises for accuracy per assessment. The second approach produces offers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Train the shortcuts. Enforce the discipline. Trust the methodology. The 60 seconds is sufficient—if you make it so.
